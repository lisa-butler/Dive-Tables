# Portfolio Project 3: Python Essentials Project
## Dive Tables
### This command-line interface was built as a Python essentials project as part of the diploma in software development at the code institute. It is designed for academic purposes only.

This command-line interface project is built around the concept of a dive computer. Dive planning and decompression control are essential elements of safe diving. The invention of the dive computer has taken much of the guess work out of it in recent years, however, those not diving a computer must utilise an algorithm such as the Buehlmann tables to ensure thir dive is safe.

This is due, predominantly, to the risk of decompression illness. When at depth and at an increased ambient pressure, the divers tissues absorb nitrogen faster. When surfacing from a dive, the diver must give adequate time for their body tissues to 'off-gas'. Not allowing enough time for this or ascending too quickly, can cause the nitrogen in the blood to form bubbles and block off essential tissues, such as the brain, spinal cord etc.

All computers operate off an algorithm that woks out how long a diver can stay at the depth they are at before they will need to add additional ascent stops to ensure they have off-gassed properly.

This project aims to create a simple and interactive dive computer based on the Buehlmann tables that can be used to plan and calculate depths, times and decos. This can provide an understanding of how dive computers work as well as aiding in dive planning and understanding the tables.

## User Experience 

<a name="ux"></a>

### **Pre project planning** 
Before starting this project i investigated the criteria in depth and opted to make an algorithm based project rather than a game or choose your own adventure. I have an interest in how dive computers work and have used dive tables quite a lot in my diver training. I have also found that many people struggle with dive tables and how to work them accurately. This project idea wasformed from this, as an attempt to create an online platform that a user could utilise to make a dive plan or a studnet could test their knowledge with.
I opted to have an information section in the project to make it a more useful tool for newcomers and those just getting to grips with tables. I also opted to have the option of analysing your decos as well as being able to plan to avoid them. In this way the calculator can be used both premtively and retrospectively.

Lucid charts was used to develop a flow of logic for each option and how it would flow through the code.

**Strategy:**
Determining the best approach meant investigating the needs of the potential users. This included the needs of the divers looking to plan their dives and calculate their decos and the students looking to learn about dive tables and to input different values to see the outcome.
**User stories:**
As a qualified diver:
I want to be able to input my depth and time and find out if i would have hit a deco stop and at what depth.
I want to be able to plan a dive based on a dive time.
I want to plan a dive based on a depth.
I want to know what algorithmm this calculator is using.
I want a quick and easy way to navigate through this program.
I want to know
